A Primitive device management system to keep tabs on all devices on your network and install things remotely.

This is a prototype. the clients should automatically look for the server and connect to it. it will send information such as all softwares that are installed on the computer, how much RAM the computer has, what OS is on the client computer and much more. However, since it is for personal use, no documentation of useage was added until the program get's worked on a bit more.
Feel free to download and change anything you want.
